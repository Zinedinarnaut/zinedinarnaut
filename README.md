### About

I’m a Sydney-based developer focused on designing and building **production-ready systems** — not just demos.

I currently build through **Nanite**, an independent systems-focused studio where I design, ship, and maintain:
- Full-stack platforms (auth, billing, dashboards, internal tools)
- AI-assisted workflows and automation
- Custom infrastructure and self-hosted services
- Experimental tooling and game-adjacent tech

I care deeply about **clarity, reliability, and long-term maintainability**.  
Tools evolve quickly — standards don’t.

If you’re building something serious and need it done properly, feel free to reach out.
