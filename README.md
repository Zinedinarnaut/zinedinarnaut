### 🧠 About Me

I'm an 18-year-old developer based in Sydney, Australia, building bleeding-edge tech from scratch — from **AI-powered VTuber systems** to **reverse-engineered game tools** and **custom server infrastructure**.

I specialize in:
- 🤖 AI Systems – LLMs (DeepSeek, GPT), local TTS (Coqui), STT (Whisper)
- 🧠 Memory Clustering, Semantic Recall, Emotional Modeling
- 🎮 Game Modding & Reverse Engineering (Unreal Engine, memory hooks)
- 🎥 VTuber Tools & VTube Studio Integration (C#, Python, WebSocket)
- 🌐 Full Stack Dev – Next.js, Tailwind, FastAPI, C#, Python
- 🖥️ Arch Linux Poweruser – Custom Hyprland setup with dev workflows

| 🎯 My Vision

I’m not here to build basic apps —
I’m here to create living, breathing, human like AI systems
that can speak, react, evolve, and entertain.

Thanks for stopping by! If you’re building something wild — or want to — I’m down to help.
